1. Season beef with salt and brown in a frying pan. Once browned remove and set aside.
2. Remove the stems and seeds from the dried chilies and sear lightly in olive oil for several minutes.
3. Remove peppers from frying pan and add to a small sauce pan with some water and boil for 5 minutes.
4. Add olive oil, garlic, tomatoes, onion powder, and brown sugar to the frying pan and cook until the tomatoes begin to break down. Add beef broth as needed.
5. Add the peppers and water to the frying pan.
6. Mix in the apple cider vinegar, line juice, oregano, paprika, cumin and cloves.
7. Once the tomatoes and peppers have broken down and everything is well combined, remove from heat and let cool.
8. Once cooled, transfer the sauce to a blender and blend until smooth.
9. Add the beef, sauce, bay leaves, cinnamon stick and more beef broth to a dutch oven and cook at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 2-3 hours. Check regularly and add beef broth as needed.
10. Remove the beef from the sauce and shred.
11. Dip tortillas in the sauce and then place it in the heated skillet/pan and fry for a few seconds.
12. Top with beef and shredded cheese. Flip in half and allow the cheese to melt and become gooey before flipping it carefully onto the opposite side. Remove from heat once golden on both sides.
13. Add some fresh chopped cilantro and a splash of lime juice to the top of the tacos.
14. Serve with a bowl of the consomme sauce for dipping.
