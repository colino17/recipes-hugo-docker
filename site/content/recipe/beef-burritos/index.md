1. Prepare one cup of Mexican rice and set aside.
2. Cook the ground beef in a skillet over medium heat, while seasoning with garlic powder, salt and pepper.
3. Add green chilies and the diced tomatoes to the skillet and cook until the tomatoes have broken down into a thick sauce.
4. Add taco seasoning and mix thoroughly.
5. Remove from heat and mix in the rice.
6. Add cheese and meat mixture to each tortilla leaving enough room to roll properly.
7. Roll up the burritos and place each seam-side down in a clean skillet with a bit of olive oil.
8. Cook the burritos until golden on all sides.
