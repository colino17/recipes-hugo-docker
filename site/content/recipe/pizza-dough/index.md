1. Mix a little sugar into the warm water and sprinkle yeast on top.
2. Wait for 10 minutes or until it gets all foamy.
3. Pour into a large bowl and combine with flour, salt, and olive oil.
4. Knead for 6-8 minutes until you have a moderately stiff dough that is smooth and elastic (add a bit more flour as needed).
5. Cover and let rest for 20-30 minutes. Each dough should be enough for two pizzas.
