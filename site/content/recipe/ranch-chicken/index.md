1. Cut the chicken lengthwise so you get thinner cutlets, and season each with pepper and garlic powder.
2. Add the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter to a skillet over medium/high heat.
3. Add the chicken to the pan and cook for about 4-5 minutes/side until golden then remove from pan.
4. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the remaining butter to the skillet, and once it's melted, stir in the flour and cook for about a minute.
5. Add broth and whisk until flour has dissolved.
6. Whisk in ranch seasoning.
7. Return the chicken to the skillet and cook for another 5 minutes or until it has finished cooking through and the sauce has thickened.
8. Serve with a side of veggies.
