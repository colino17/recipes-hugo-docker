1. Pat the meat chunks off with paper towels and season generously with salt and pepper.
2. Add olive oil and beef to Instant Pot and use saute function to sear beef until browned (approximately 6 minutes per side).
3. Remove beef from pot and saute garlic, onion powder, rosemary, thyme, salt and pepper for one minute.
4. Add balsamic vinegar, tomatoes, beef broth, mustard, and bay leaves, smashing the tomatoes against the side to break them up a bit.
5. Add seared beef and cook on high pressure for 30 minutes, allowing the pressure to naturally release for 15 minutes afterward.
6. Cut vegetables into large chunks and add to the pot.
7. Cook on high pressure for another 10 minutes.
