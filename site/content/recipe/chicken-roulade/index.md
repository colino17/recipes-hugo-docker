1. Preheat oven to 375° F.
2. Chop the bacon and cook slowly over low heat until crispy. Reserve the drippings and set aside.
3. Cut the chicken in half lengthwise to create 2 thinner slices. Cover with parchment paper and pound it to an even thickness of ¼-inch.
4. Season both sides with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.
5. Evenly distribute the cheese and bacon over the middle of the chicken and then roll the chicken up neatly and seal with a toothpick.
6. Sear all sides of the chicken rolls in the bacon drippings until golden brown.
7. Transfer to a lightly greased baking dish seam-side-down and sprinkle with italian seasoning and paprika.
8. Cover and bake for 17 minutes. Remove cover and bake for 8 more minutes.
9. Serve with veggies or rice.
