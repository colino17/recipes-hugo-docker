1. Slice chicken breasts into bite-sized chunks and season with salt, pepper, and onion powder.
2. Wash and trim the ends of the asparagus, blanche them in boiling water for 2 minutes, then soak them in cold water to stop the cooking.
3. Cook the chicken bites with half the butter (1/4 cup) and olive oil in a large skillet until golden brown. 
4. Lower the temperature and add the minced garlic and Italian seasoning. Cook for one more minute and then remove chicken from the skillet. 
5. Deglaze the skillet with chicken broth. Bring to a simmer and allow to reduce to half the volume. 
6. Add the remaining 1/4 cup butter, lemon juice, and parsley. Stir to combine.
7. Add the blanched asparagus and toss for 2 minutes.
8. Push asparagus on the side, add the sauteed chicken bites back to the pan, and stir for another minute to reheat. 
9. Garnish the chicken and asparagus with more parsley and crushed red pepper flakes.
