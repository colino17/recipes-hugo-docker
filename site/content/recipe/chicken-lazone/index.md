3. Coat each piece with flour.
4. Add the butter and oil to a skillet over medium-high heat.
5. Cook the chicken for 4-5 minutes per side until golden then remove from pan and set aside.
6. Whisk in the cream and until the brown bits from the bottom of the pan are incorporated into the sauce.
7. Whisk in remaining spices.
