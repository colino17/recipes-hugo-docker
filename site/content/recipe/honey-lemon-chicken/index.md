1. Cut your chicken breasts in half lengthwise so you have four thinner cutlets. Sprinkle them with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Dredge them in flour so they're evenly coated.
2. Add the oil and two tablespoons of the butter to a skillet over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, add the chicken and cook it for 4-5 minutes/side or until golden.
3. Take the chicken out of the pan and set it aside. Stir in the chicken broth, lemon juice, honey, and the rest of the butter and add the chicken back in.
4. Cook the chicken for another 5 minutes or so (medium-high heat), until the sauce has reduced and thickened a bit and the chicken is fully cooked through. Spoon the sauce over the chicken.
