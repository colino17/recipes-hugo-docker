1. Measure the corn flour, lard, and salt into the mixing bowl.
2. Pour very hot tap water over the lard to melt it.
3. Mix the dough with a wooden spoon at first, then by hand until it is very smooth.
4. Press the dough into a rectangle and wrap in plastic and leave to rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.
5. Heat flat bottomed cast iron skillet over medium heat.
6. Cut the dough into 16 equal pieces, leaving them under the plastic, so they don't dry out.
7. Slide freezer bags over top and bottom halves of the tortilla press.
8. Place a ball of dough in the middle of the press, just slightly closer to the hinge and press until flattened.
9. Gently peel the corn tortilla off the plastic and move it to the hot skillet.
10. Cook for approximately one minute per side.
11. Move tortilla to a holding plate and cover with a towel to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining dough.
